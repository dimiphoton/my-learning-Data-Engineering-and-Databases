# my-learning-Data-Engineering-and-Databases
my learning repo for various database techs

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to the world of data engineering and database management. This project serves a dual purpose:

Professional Portfolio: To showcase my skills and tangible projects in data modeling, storage, manipulation, and management.

Learning Guide: To structure my personal development path by focusing on the core concepts and skills that deliver the most impact.

This README acts as a living document and a roadmap for my journey. Each checked box represents a concept I have studied and applied in a project.

Learning Roadmap
This repository is organized into several modules, each representing a core pillar of data engineering.

1. The Foundation: SQL and Relational Modeling
This section covers the core skills for querying, structuring, and manipulating data within any relational database system.

üéØ 80/20 Objectives:
[ ] Master SELECT statements with JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)

[ ] Utilize Aggregate Functions (GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT(), SUM(), AVG())

[ ] Filter Data with WHERE, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

[ ] Define Data Structures with CREATE TABLE (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)

[ ] Apply Normalization Principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)

[ ] Perform Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) within transactions

2. NoSQL Databases: MongoDB for Flexibility
This section focuses on the skills needed for document-oriented databases, ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.

üéØ 80/20 Objectives:
[ ] Understand the Document Model (Collections, Documents, BSON/JSON)

[ ] Query Documents with find() and Projections

[ ] Use Advanced Query Operators ($eq, $gt, $lt, $in, $and, $or)

[ ] Insert Documents (insertOne(), insertMany())

[ ] Modify Documents (updateOne(), updateMany() with the $set operator)

[ ] Implement Indexing (single-field and compound indexes)

3. Geospatial Data with PostGIS üåç
This section covers specialized skills for storing, querying, and analyzing geographic data.

üéØ 80/20 Objectives:
[ ] Work with Core Geometry Types (POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON)

[ ] Perform Spatial Measurements (ST_Distance)

[ ] Analyze Spatial Relationships (ST_Contains, ST_Within, ST_Intersects)

[ ] Manage Coordinate Systems (ST_Transform, SRID)

[ ] Leverage Spatial Indexes (GiST)

4. Database Management & Administration (DBMS)
This section includes the essential operational and "DevOps" skills for managing a database system.

üéØ 80/20 Objectives:
[ ] Manage Users and Privileges (CREATE USER, GRANT, REVOKE)

[ ] Implement Backup and Restore Procedures (e.g., pg_dump)

[ ] Analyze Query Performance (EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

[ ] Develop an Indexing Strategy (B-Tree, Hash, GiST indexes)
